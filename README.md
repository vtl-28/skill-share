# Talk Host
Talk Host is a platform that brings people with a shared interest together and allows them to give small, informal presentations about things they know. At a gardening skill-sharing meeting, someone might explain how to cultivate celery. Or in a 
programming skill-sharing group, you could drop by and tell people about Node.js. An individual would host a group of people to give a talk about something he or she knows or is good at

## About
The idea to build this project came to me after reaching the end of the popular Eloquent Javascript book back when I was learning Javascript. I thought it would be a 
really fun and not-too-challenging project to build to practice and solidify my Javascript, React and Nodejs knowledge

## Demo

## Installation

- Once you have a copy of the project on your machine, open your terminal and split it into two: one for the server, and the other for the client.

In the client terminal, navigate to the client folder and run npm install command to install all dependencies for the client. Once that is done, head back to your server terminal, in the root of the project and run the npm start command to launch the application. Run the same command in the client directory
